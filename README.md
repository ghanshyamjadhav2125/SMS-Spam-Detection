# ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The objective of this project is to detect spam SMS messages based on their content. The process involves:

Preprocessing SMS text using NLP techniques

Applying machine learning models like SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest

Implementing ensemble techniques to improve classification accuracy

# ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language

Scikit-learn: For model training and evaluation

NLTK: For natural language processing

Pandas & NumPy: Data handling and manipulation

TfidfVectorizer: Feature extraction using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization libraries

# ðŸ“Š Dataset Information
The dataset contains SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.

Each SMS message serves as the input feature, while the label (spam or ham) is the target variable.

Text processing includes cleaning, tokenization, and feature transformation using TF-IDF.
